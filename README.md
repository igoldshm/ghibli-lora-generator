# ghibli-lora-generator
This project demonstrates a lightweight fine-tuning approach (LoRA) applied to Stable Diffusion to generate images in the style of Studio Ghibli. A custom dataset was curated, and a LoRA adapter was trained on top of SD v1.5. The project includes a live inference notebook and an interactive web demo built with Gradio.
